# HeartRateMonitor
This Project can be used to detect heart beat using pulse sensor and libraries such as-
liquidcrystal.h for controlling the lcd display
playground.h for controlling the pulse sensor


When a heartbeat occurs blood is pumped through the human body and gets squeezed into the capillary tissues.
Consequently, the volume of these capillary tissues increases. But in between the two consecutive heartbeats, this volume inside capillary tissues decreases. 
This change in volume between the heartbeats affects the amount of light that will transmit through these tissues. 
This can be measured with the help of a microcontroller.
The pulse sensor module has a light which helps in measuring the pulse rate. 
When we place the finger on the pulse sensor, the light reflected will change based on the volume of blood inside the capillary blood vessels.
This variation in light transmission and reflection can be obtained as a pulse from the output of pulse sensor. 
This pulse can be then conditioned to measure heartbeat and then programmed accordingly to read as heartbeat count using Arduino.
And the point and all the working is explained through including libraries and coding in c language.
